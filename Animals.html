  that are lighton their feet. They are often mistaken for other

<h2 style="background-color:Gray;">Panda</h2>
<p style="background-color:Gray;">High in dense bamboo forests
  in the misty, rainy mountains of southwestern China lives one of
  the world's rarest mammals: the giant panda , also called the
  panda. Only about 1,500 of these black-and-white relatives of
  bears survive in the wild. Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo
  shoots and leaves.</p>
